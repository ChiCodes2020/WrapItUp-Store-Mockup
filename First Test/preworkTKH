Outside of elementary and middle school "computer class" where we had Mavis Beacon typing classes and did a variety of math and reading games, actual tech was nothing really taught to me/talked about. I never had access to a robotic class/club, never had technology class, or a coding class through elementary, middle, and highschool. I can't fully answer the reasons why I didn't
