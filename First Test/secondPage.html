        <h2 id="reasons"> Reasons to celebrate Black History Month
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> To honor the lives of Black people who fought, died, and paved a way for not only Black Americans but for Black people, the oppressed, and people worldwide.
            Some of these people include <span id="peoplespan"> Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hammer, Stokely Carmichael, Ella Baker, </span> etc.
            <li> To bring awareness to the contributions Black people have made and still make today, as well as awareness to the struggles Black people still face.
            </li>
            <li> To uplift the community because often times the media, educational institutions, and society only display negative images and characterizations. </li>
            <li> Because Black the contributions of Black people is often overlooked. </li>
            <li> Because Black history is American History. </li>
            <li> To remember how far we have come and to use that as a catalyst to continue growing, fighting for justice, utlilizing all our potential, and being great.
        </ul>

        <h3 id="ways"> Ways to celebrate Black History Month
        </h3>
          <p> * A friend of mine recently asked "What traditions do you do to celebrate Black History Month"/How do you celebrate Black History Month? So, I thought about that and listed below are some things that came to mind-things that I know people do,
             things that I do/have done, and things that I wish to possibly incorporate in my future Black History Month celebrations. </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Educate and share knowledge of Black lives, history, and contributions. They could be through discussion, sharing resources on social media, etc. That could look like making an effort to honor someone, posting a fact, sharing some interesting knowledge that we often haven't learned each day of the month.</li>
          <li> Giving back to/investing in Black communities. That could look like supporting black business & people, donating your money or time to a cause or non-profit geared towards justice for Black people. It could look like mentoring too. </li>
          <li> Supporting Black businesses <span id=blackbusiness> (had to say that again). </li>
          <li> Watching some black films </li>
          <li> Listening to music by Black artist. I think some oldies, jazz, and soul is definitely a vibe for this month. lol
          <li> Educating yourself and read some books by Black authors.
            <br>

            <p> *Note these things don't need to be and shouldn't be only saved for the month of February.
